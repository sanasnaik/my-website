                    WINNER of the  Best Social Good Hack at HackHers 2023! <br>
                    frogspawn is a chatbot that I made with my friends Kapila and Sabrina for the HackHers Hackathon, hosted at Rutgers University. <br>
                    The main function of the bot is to generate frogs for the user,
                    inform them on endangered frog species, and encourage people to donate to and support preservation organizations. It also has other cool features,
                    like reacting to messages with "frog" emojis. 🐸 <br>
                    This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, GitHub, and Discord.js.

                <h2>Calculate Implausible Bounds</h2>
                <p>SAP program developed for FirstEnergy Corp. (In testing as of August 29th 2024)<br>
                    This is my biggest self-made project as an intern at FirstEnergy! As an intern, I learned
                    all about SAP development and was introduced to OpenSQL. 
                    <br>The goal of this project is to automate the process of determining "implausible" kilowatt hours of electricity usage 
                    measured by a meter. For instance, if a value is too high or too low to be realistic, the meter might be broken. To determind this, we compare it with its 
                    historical readings and calculate whether it is within plausible usage bounds.
                    <br>Working with a Python data scientist, my goal was to experiment if it was possible to recreate his program in SAP, which would make it faster 
                    to retrieve data and calculate plausible meter reading bounds. For each "bin" - ex. during a certain month of the year, in a certain location - 
                    I would take all the recorded meter readings and use percentiles to calculate the lower x% bound and higher y% bound
                    between which (y-x)% of the data fell. <br>
                    Thus, rather than having each meter reading manually checked and approved by employees, the program would automate the process,
                    making it easier for us to tell whether the meter reading is an accurate or inaccurate value, and whether that meter should be replaced.
                    <br>I worked with datasets with millions of records, using my statistics knowledge to try and make the program as efficient as possible.
                    This project uses SAP ABAP and OpenSQL statements.

                <p>Data 101 Final Project: used R code on a dataset to predict whether asteroids/NEOs would be classified as hazardous or non-hazardous.
                <br>What I Did: 
                <br>I used Kaggle to find a dataset I was interested in using, which was the “Nearest Earth Objects” dataset sourced from NASA. I plotted the variables from the 
                    dataset to gain some insight into it. It had information on different asteroids and other NEOs such as their names, estimated sizes, relative velocity, 
                    miss distance, absolute magnitude, and whether or not they were classified as hazardous. I then created a decision tree using rpart for the dataset to predict
                        whether or not an asteroid would be classified as hazardous based on its characteristics. I also used naive Bayes to create predictions, and then I compared 
                        the accuracies of both methods using their confusion matrices.
                <br> This project is coded in R.

                    Work in progress!<br>
                    I was inspired to make this game after watching "3 Body Problem" on Netflix and learning the Dark Forest theory.
                    Basically, this game is in the perspective of a human working for a company responsible for "global security and defense".
                    As the player continues getting through each level, they learn about the true nature of their employment.
                    Each level involves real exoplanets sourced from the NASA exoplanet archive.
                    <br> This game is a personal project, and I am coding it in Python using the Pygame library. 
                    <br> This game uses TAP (Table Acccess Protocol) queries which incorporate SQL statements to access NASA databases, specifically
                    the NASA exoplanet archive.

                <p> Coding Subteam 2019-2022 <br>
                    I participated as a robot programmer on my high school's FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) robotics team. <br>
                    During my time, I learned how to gather sensor data and use Java to program motors, drivebases, and pneumatics on the bot. 
                    As a team, we collaborated on GitHub to write and test code that lets the robot run 100% autonomously.
                    I primarily programmed Ursa’s color sensors and drivebase mechanisms and mentored new members during the summer.
